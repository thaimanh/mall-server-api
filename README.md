## ❯ Getting Started

### Step 1: Set up the Development Environment

You need to set up your development environment before you can do anything.

Install [Node.js and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

- on OSX use [homebrew](http://brew.sh) `brew install node`
- on Windows use [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) `choco install nodejs`

Install yarn globally

```bash
npm i yarn -g
```

Install a PostgresSQL database.

> If you work with a mac, we recommend to use homebrew for the installation.

### Step 2: Create new Project

Fork or download this project. Configure your package.json for your new project.

Then copy the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`. In this file you have to add your database connection information.

Create a new database with the name you have in your `.env`-file.

Run this yarn script to install module for project
```bash
yarn install
```

### Step 3: Serve your App

Go to the project dir and start your app with this yarn script to run server + load database.
```bash
yarn dev
```
